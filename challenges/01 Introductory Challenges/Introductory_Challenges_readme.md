##Welcome to the CodeSLO Test Engine

####Introductory Challenges

The purpose of the introductory challenges is to help you get comfortable with the CodeSLO Test Engine and to make sure you understand foundational JavaScript concepts.

Completeing these tests will help you be successful with more difficult coding challenges to come.

####Getting Started
1. Create a new folder in the root of test client directory. This folder *must* be named **my_solutions**.
2. Copy the folders inside the **challenges** directory and paste them into your **my_solutions** directory.
3. Solve and run your challenges from your **my_solutions** folder. Trying to run challenges inside the **challenges** folder will generate an error.

####How to Solve the Challenges
1. Each coding challenge comes in it's own folder. *Example: Create A Function*
2. Each folder contains several files but you're only interested in two. The **.challenge.js** file and the **readme.md** file. **Readme.md** contains instructions for the test. **.challenge.js** is where you will attempt to solve the challenge.
3. When you're ready to solve the challenge, edit the **.challenge.js** file in order to return the correct values. You can run this test locally using the Code Runner extension.
4. When you feel your solution is ready, open a command prompt in the folder of your current challenge. Then, enter the command **node test**.
5. In the VS Code Terminal, you will receive feeback that lets you know if you passed the test or not. If you do not pass, it will also give you hints as to what you need to fix. You may submit a test any number of times.
6. If you don't see pass *or* fail feedback, you are probably using the command prompt from the wrong directory or you misnamed your function. Be sure to use the function name specified in the test readme.
